# IncrementalLearning & OpenWorldRecognition
## Abstract
Image classifcation is one of the most challenging fields in artificial intelligence. In particular, two of the most studied and difficult tasks are incremental learning and open world recognition: the former consists in incrementally adding new classes to a model and the problem, which is known in literature as catastrophic forgetting, occurs when the model forgets about its known classes while updating its parame- ters in respect to the new ones. The latter refers to the capability of a model to recognize if an image belongs to a class that hasn't learned yet, so that the image can be classified as unknown. The aim of this project is to explore these two problems, with the help of some of the most famous re- lated papers, and to create a framework that combines the two tasks, which will be able t o learn new classes incremen- tally and at the same time to reject images from unknown classes. Finally, we propose our own modification
